# Delete Slack Messages Script

Deletes all slack messages from the #general channel.

## Why does anyone need this script?

Apparently, Slack does not allow to delete the #general channel or easily clean its history ([see more info](https://slack.com/intl/en-il/help/articles/220105027-The-general-channel)). Deleting the messages one by one is annoying, hence this script.

## Instructions

-   Get the workspace url and a user with admin permissions.
-   Replace the WORKSPACE_URL, EMAIL and PASSWORD variable values at the top of the script. 
-   Run the script and wait for the magic to happen :)

**NOTE** - Unfortunately, this script does not yet work with accounts connected using Google (which do not have a password).
